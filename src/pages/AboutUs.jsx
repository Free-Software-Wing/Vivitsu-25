          campaign for Free and Open Source Softwares. We provide participants

          <b>Some of the main objectives of FSW are:</b>
          <br />
          * To promote the use and benefits of FOSS among students and the
          community
          <br />
          * To encourage students to contribute to the FOSS community through
          coding and other activities
          <br />
          * To provide a platform for students to learn and collaborate on FOSS
          projects
